so 
How does the react native works ?
so to clarify that what we write is a react code that is compiled to the target native platform code.
but the next important thing that we need is the business logic is stored as business logic itself and
the VM is created by the system where the javascript code is executed by the bridge to the respective native platforms 
api.
Expo or reactnative-cli
styling is done by javascript not the css.

1 view
2 text
3 touchable
4 textinput
5 image
6 button
 inline and styelsheet properties are used here.
 but only subset and few features are supported.
 style sheet will automatically add the validation before applying to the components .
